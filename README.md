# DIMT-RRT
This repository contains a **Python** implementation of a kinodynamic planning algorithm integrating RRT with a steering method built on the "double-integrator minimum time" formulation from the paper **["Probabilistically Complete Kinodynamic Planning for Robot Manipulators with Acceleration Limits"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6943083), IROS 2014**.

It operates several orders of magnitude faster than the [kinodynamic RRT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/770022) algorithm.

ðŸ“Œ Note: This implementation is a reproduction of the original paper.
